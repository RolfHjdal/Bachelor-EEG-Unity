# Bachelor-EEG-Unity
A unity project using EEG to control a character in a wheelchair
How to use:
1. Clone files in desktop
2. Unfortunately the edk.dll, edk_utils.dll, and DotNetEmotivSDK.dll cannot be distributed freely due to copyright, so these must be supplied  
individually. Copy edk.dll and edk_utils.dll to ../Unity/Editor/
3. Edit EmoCognitiv.cs according to "Plugin-Readme.pdf", so that the engine connects to the correct signal source.
4. Run EnvoirmentWithoutOculus.unity
5. (optional) Extract Assets/Animatii/basic pack.rar using winRAR to get a person in the wheelchair.
